title: 'Strategies for handling joint accounts'
---

Situation:  I am using Actual to keep track of my budget and finances, but I share a joint account with my partner.

## Basic setup steps
1. Create an **on-budget** account used to pay joint bills.
2. Create a **category group** used to group your shared expense categories.
3. Create the **categories** you plan to budget using your joint account.
4. **Optional** Create an **Income Category** called **Partner Contribution** or something similar.

## Adding funds to the joint account

### Your contribution

Each month you will add a transfer of your share to the joint account from one of your on-budget accounts.  You don't need a category for your contribution.  

### Partner contribution

#### Option 1

When your partner makes a contribution to the joint account, use the **Income Category** you created as the category.  By having a separate category for this contribution, it will be easier to filter it out when doing reports later since this isn't true income, though it is income to the budget.  

#### Option 2

If option 1 doesn't seem right to you, the same result could be achieved by treating the new income like a return to a store.  In this case, you could assign the deposit to the joint account to a category.
