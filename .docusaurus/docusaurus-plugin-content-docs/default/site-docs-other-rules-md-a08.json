  "description": "Introduced in 0.0.124, rules determine how a transaction is processed. When importing or syncing transactions, they are run through a list of rules that can apply actions to the transaction. For example, a rule could process a transaction with the payee AMAZON.COM*5C7QC7MH0 AM 10/26 PURCHASE AMZN.COM/BILL, and because it contains the word \"amazon\", sets the payee to \"Amazon\" and the category to \"my fun stuff\". Rules allow you to automate any workflow you want.",
